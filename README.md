## What is myFlix?
Movie enthusiasts like to be able to access information about different movies,
whenever they want to. myFlix users will be able to use it whenever they want to read and save information
about different movies. With myFlix, having the ability to save a list of their favorite movies will ensure
users always have access to the films they want to watch or recommend to their peers.

This project uses the myFlix API, also created by Priya Maharban.<br><br>
